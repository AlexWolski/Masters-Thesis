A long-standing goal of computer vision and geometry processing is to efficiently and accurately reconstruct complex 3D geometry. Deep learning techniques are a popular approach for their ability to automatically generalize features from limited input information. Recent work in deep 3D learning explores the use of Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) modeling; a method to build complex volumes by combining simple, atomic shape primitives. Prior work succeeds in generating up to 100 output primitives, allowing for the accurate reconstruction of simple objects. In this work, we propose the Constructive Solid Geometry Cascaded Refinement Network (CSG-CRN): a model capable of reconstructing complex geometry using an unlimited number of shape primitives. We implement an unsupervised autoencoder network to iteratively improve a reconstruction through cascaded refinement. A contrastive encoder network analyzes the differences between a target and reconstruction point cloud. Then a Multi-Level Perceptron (MLP) decoder network predicts multiple shape primitives to refine the reconstruction.
