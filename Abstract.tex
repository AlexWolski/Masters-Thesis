A long-standing goal of computer vision and geometry processing is to efficiently and accurately reconstruct complex 3D geometry. Deep learning techniques have quickly become a popular solution to the problem owing to their ability to automatically learn and generalize features. Recent works have implemented deep 3D reconstruction using Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) modeling. This is a method to build complex volumes by combining simple, atomic shape primitives. Prior works have had great success in accurately reconstructing simple objects as a combination of 3-5 shape primitives. In this work, we propose a model capable of reconstructing more complex geometry using an unlimited number of shape primitives. We implement an unsupervised encoder-decoder network that iteratively predicts primitive shapes to add to the reconstruction. The model relies on a Siamese encoder network to analyze the difference between the target and reconstruction point clouds. Then a GRU decoder  sequentially predicts multiple shape primitives to add to the reconstruction.
