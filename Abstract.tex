A long-standing goal of computer vision and geometry processing is to efficiently and accurately reconstruct complex 3D geometry. Deep learning techniques have become a popular solution for their ability to automatically generalize features. Recent work in deep 3D learning implements Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) modeling to generate 3D geometry. This is a method to build complex volumes by combining simple, atomic shape primitives. Prior work generates up to 100 shape primitives, allowing for the accurate reconstruction of simple objects. In this work, we propose the Constructive Solid Geometry Cascaded Refinement Network (CSG-CRN): a model capable of reconstructing complex geometry using an unlimited number of shape primitives. We implement an unsupervised autoencoder network to iteratively improve a reconstruction through cascaded refinement. The model relies on a Siamese encoder network to analyze the differences between a target and reconstruction point cloud. Then a Multi-Level Perceptron (MLP) decoder sequentially predicts multiple shape primitives to refine the reconstruction.
