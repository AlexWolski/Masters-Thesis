A long-standing goal of computer vision and geometry processing is to efficiently and accurately reconstruct complex 3D geometry. Deep learning techniques have become a popular solution to the problem because of their ability to automatically learn and generalize features. Recent works have implemented deep learning to generate 3D reconstructions using Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) modeling. This is a method to build complex volumes by combining simple, atomic shape primitives. Prior works have had great success in accurately reconstructing simple objects using several dozen shape primitives. In this work, we propose the Constructive Solid Geometry Cascaded Refinement Network (CSG-CRN): a model capable of reconstructing complex geometry using an unlimited number of shape primitives. We implement an unsupervised autoencoder network to iteratively improve a reconstruction through cascaded refinement. The model relies on a Siamese encoder network to analyze the differences between a target and reconstruction point cloud. Then a Multi-Level Perceptron (MLP) decoder sequentially predicts multiple shape primitives to refine the reconstruction.
