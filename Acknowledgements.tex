First and foremost I thank my project advisor, Dr. Mark Stamp, for his support and guidance throughout this project and during my time as a Master's student. He has taught me the magic of machine learning and has inspired me to pursue it as a career. This project would not have been possible without Mark's passion for the field and dedication to sharing his knowledge.

I want to thank my committee members Dr. Fabio DiTroia and Dr. Stas Tiomkin for their feedback and collaboration on this project. Their input has been invaluable to the creation of this work.

I thank the organizers and presenters of the Eurographics Symposium on Geometry Processing for exposing me to the field of geometry processing and inspiring this project. I thank I{\~n}igo Qu{\'i}lez for creating educational articles on signed distance fields and allowing me to reprint them in this work.

Last but not least, I thank my family and friends for their continued support and enabling me to succeed in this program. I dedicate a special thanks to my friend Dr. Pax Kivim{\"a}e for having the patience to answer my many questions and helping direct the vision for this project.
