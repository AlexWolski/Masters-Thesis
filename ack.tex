First and foremost, I dedicate a special thanks to my project advisor Dr. Mark Stamp for his support and guidance throughout this project and during my time as a Master's student. He has taught me of the magic of machine learning and has inspired me to pursue it as a career. This project would not have been possible without Mark's passion for the topic and dedication to sharing his knowledge.

I want to thank my committee members Dr. Fabio DiTroia and Dr. Stas Tiomkin for their feedback and expert opinions. Their input has been invaluable to the creation of this work.

I also want to thank Dr. Genya Ishigaki, Dr. Rana Hanocka, and Dr. Pax Kivimae for answering my many questions and helping direct the goals of my project.

And last but not least, I want to thank my family for their continued support and enabling me to succeed in education.
